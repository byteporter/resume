    Designed the electrical circuit and authored software for a scientific instrument which uses a Freescale HCS12 microcontroller. This solution used FreeRTOS and the CodeWarrior C IDE for writing and debugging. The companion data acquisition software was written in C# .NET and used a MS SQL file-backed database to store the data.

    Standout achievements were a fully custom display driver to run the graphical LCD including bitmap fonts, and using Direct3D to draw the graphs in the companion application quickly and smoothly using the GPU. Custom routines were also created to ensure that the hard copy printouts of the charts were perfect.
